# CoolestByteInTheWebsite

Project still not fully implemented due to some technical issues with the web domain.
Locally saved screenshots from the web camera stream, which will be used for detecting sentiments, cannot be used.

# Edit
Used ngrok for testing the whole website. It can be accessed *for now* at http://2351cfcc.ngrok.io/CoolestByteInTheWebsite/
Website uses the Sentiment extraction API from Microsoft in order to give an appropiate response.
